Flashcardzz is a flashcard creator that allows you to share your notes with the world. The backend is almost entirely complete. 

Users can : create an account, CRUD (decks and cards), choose if you want to make them public, at which time the website will update and we can see every deck alphabetically based on category & deck title. 

Coming soon, I will be working on the front end. I will add animations to make the card visually flip when you press the flip button. I will be adding information on how to get free college credits with CLEP and collegeboard.org. After that I may build out a test creator or choose to implement AI to help make decks of cards.
